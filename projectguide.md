In this project, I will be creating viruse files. Relatively harmless and easy-to-detect viruses, but still ones that in the wrong hands could cause harm to a computer. Like a scientist studying biological viruses, it's okay for me to do this, but ONLY in a safe laboratory environment. My virus handling safety rule was to make sure I didn't take the viruses out of my Ubuntu VM.
If I remove them from my VM, even for my own personal use or to prank a friend or something else well-meaning, I could accidentally be committing a crime ðŸš¨ . 

My only exception to this rule is uploading the virus files directly to the anti-virus software VirusTotal.com which I am going to do later in order to detect and confirm the virus files' existence.

I'll begin by starting my Ubuntu VM, opening a terminal, and checking to ensure MSFVenom is installed:

I'll be creating viruses using msfvenom. I'll begin by running this syntax(msfvenom -a ARCHITECTURE --platform PLATFORM -p PAYLOAD [ARGS] -f FORMAT -o OUTPUTFILE)

Now, I'll explain some of the steps involved in my syntax:
-a is for the computer architecture. This is something determined by the kind of CPU in the computer you're using. Most modern computers run on x64 or x86 architecture.
--platform is for what computing platform the virus should run on. For us, that means the OS/programming language, such as windows, osx, or python
-p is the PAYLOAD. This is what the virus will actually do. MSFVenom offers hundreds built-in payloads, similar to metasploit modules.
-f is the FORMAT of the output file. For example, .exe, .sh, .py, etc.
-o is the output file -- the name of the virus you're creating!

All of that in mind, I'll create the first virus. We'll use the windows/messagebox payload.
I'll run this command(msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Virus Executed" -f exe -o messageVirus.exe)

With this command we have now attained the messagevirus.exe virus file. This will be my first virus file among the three I will be creating.
Great, now Ill show you how multiple payloads can be bundled together into one virus.

First, you need to create the first payload. I'll use another messagebox, but this time I'll save it using the raw format:

I'll run the following command: 
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows \
  -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Virus Executed" \
  -f raw > messageBox

The \ character tells the terminal to continue the command on the next line. This is handy for long commands, so I'll use it throughout this project!

This command will generate a file called message box as shown above.

Next, I will run another command with the -c flag to bundle in the payload I just created.
I'll make the virus file using this command:
msfvenom -c messageBox -a x86 --platform windows \
  -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -o pwnedVirus.exe

I have now created a second virus file on my Ubuntu VM called pwnedVirus.exe.

Finally, I'll try to create an encrypted payload to see if that can slips past the anti-virus detection!

The following is the syntax I'll add to the command that will create an encrypted payload:
(-e ENCODER -i NUM_EXECUTIONS)

To encrypt, I'm going to wrap out payload in a python file, and encrypt it this time:

I'll run the following command(msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows \
  -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Encrypted Virus" \
  -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 3 -f python -o messageEncrypted)
<img width="809" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-29 at 7 13 07 PM" src="https://github.com/larnelle15/DIY-Malware/assets/139686202/df89ccb2-edde-4d69-aa2c-1af6b83da1f4">

Shikata_ga_nai is a japanese phrase that translates to "There's no other way." In the context of cybersecurity, "shikata ga nai" might refer to the acceptance of certain risks or situations that cannot be easily mitigated or avoided and this can be translated into the command above and its output.

Then, using the encrypted file generated above, I'll create the virus file by running the following command
(msfvenom -c messageEncrypted -a x86 \
  --platform windows -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -o pyVirus.exe)

  <img width="738" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-29 at 7 19 48 PM" src="https://github.com/larnelle15/DIY-Malware/assets/139686202/ea27d251-18da-4e74-ac43-91b3c58a4e76">

We have now created our third virus file called pyVirus.exe!
