In this project, I will be creating viruses. Relatively harmless and easy-to-detect viruses, but still ones that in the wrong hands could cause harm to a computer. Like a scientist studying biological viruses, it's okay for me to do this, but ONLY in a safe laboratory environment. My virus handling safety rule was to make sure I didn't take the viruses out of my Ubuntu VM.
If I remove them from my VM, even for my own personal use or to prank a friend or something else well-meaning, I could accidentally be committing a crime ðŸš¨ .

The only exception to this rule is uploading the virus files directly to VirusTotal.com which I am going to do later in order to detect and confirm the virus files' existence.
